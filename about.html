            <!-- Additional information about being a student and focusing on web development skills -->
            <p>
                I'm currently a student taking InfoTech as my college course. I prioritize learning web development skills,
                and although my current skills may be lacking, I hope to develop them by being disciplined in my studies.
            </p>
            <p>
                Though I may lack in some areas, I make up for it by being diligent and putting twice the effort into things
                I can actually see myself being able to do.
